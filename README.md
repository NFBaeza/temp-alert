# ESP32 Touch Sensor-MQTT

This repository is just a coding sandbox using ESP32 in C/C++.

## Task:

- Touch one of the ESP32's touch sensor and send a message through MQTT (tcp) to broker.

## Next step:

- Refactor the main code using classes and organize it into separate folders
- Integrate the MQTT broker with a database (to be decided).
- Develop a website to visualize ESP32 data.

Well, let's get fun!
